    "### Regression and Classification with the Ames Housing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "You work for a real estate company interested in using data science to determine the best properties to buy and re-sell. Specifically, your company would like to identify the characteristics of residential houses that estimate the sale price and the cost-effectiveness of doing renovations.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three components to the project:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Estimate the sale price of properties based on their \"fixed\" characteristics, such as neighborhood, lot size, number of stories, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Estimate the impact of possible renovations to properties from the variation in sale price not explained by the fixed characteristics.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Bonus Question: Determine the features in the housing data that best predict \"abnormal\" sales (foreclosures, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The full description of the data features can be found in a separate file in the project-3 repo: data_description.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For question one and two you will likely need to test different models to arrive at your \"best model\" for each question. This should not be an exhaustive exercise as the cleaning and eda ahead is significant enough by itself.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "#### This project uses the [Ames housing data recently made available on kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).\n",
